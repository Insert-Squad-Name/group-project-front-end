# Content Management System (name TBD)

## Prompt
Build an app to build a website! our app must allow non-technical users to write blog posts **and** pages for the site. When a visitor visits our site, they should see content. When a user logs in, they should see a dashboard that lets them create and edit new posts or pages.

**Reach Goal**: Implement authorization. Administrators should be able to delete pages or posts, while normal users should be able to edit pages. Only administrators can publish a new post, normal users can only save drafts.

## Roles:

- **Project Lead/Product Lead: Kevin**

  Accountable for team meetings, team progress, and time management. Also accountable for team decisions on product features, scope, and timeline.

- **Front-End Lead: Jason**

  Accountable for team decisions on front-end implementation strategy and front-end dependencies and tools. Also accountable for front-end execution.

- **Back-End Lead: Robert**

  Accountable for team decisions on back-end implementation strategy and back-end dependencies and tools. Also accountable for back-end execution.

- **Quality Assurance: Jeremiah**

  Accountable for code quality through frequent pair-programming and code review. Also accountable for proper use of Git (commit messages, branching/merging strategies) throughout the project. If your group only has three members, everyone is jointly and individually accountable for quality.

## Technical Requirements
Our app **MUST**:
- [ ]   **Use Mongo and Express** to build an API.
- [ ] **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user.
- [ ] Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one non-user model.
- [ ]  **Consume our own API** by making a front-end with HTML, Javascript, and jQuery
- [ ]  **Use authentication in our API** to restrict access to appropriate users.
- [ ]  **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github.
- [ ]  Layout and style our front-end with **clean and well-formatted CSS**.
- [ ]  **Deploy our application online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Necessary Deliverables
- [ ]  A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the
    internet.
- [ ]  A **client app that consumes our API, built be the whole team**,
 hosted somewhere on the internet.
- [ ]  **At least two Git repositories** (front-end and back-end) **hosted on
    Github**, with frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the
    _very beginning_ of the project.
    - The `README.md` file inside our   _**front-end**_ repo should have:

        - [ ] A short description of our application.
        - [ ] A brief explanation of the **technologies** (Node modules, Express
            middleware etc) used.
        - [ ]  A couple of paragraphs detailing the **general approach you took**.
        - [ ] Notes on any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** our team had to
            overcome.
        - [ ] **Installation instructions** for any dependencies.
        -   A link to our **user stories** – who are our users, what do they want,
            and why?
        - [ ]  A link to our **ERD** - what data models does our app use?
        - [ ] A link to our **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
            our application.
        - [ ] A link to the deployed front-end app.
        - [ ] A link to the repo for our back-end.

    - The `README.md` file inside our _**back-end**_ repo should have:**back-end**_

      - [ ] A short description of our application.
   - [ ] A **catalog of routes (paths and methods)** that the API expects.
   - [ ] A link to the deployed back-end app.
   - [ ] A link to the repo for our front-end.
