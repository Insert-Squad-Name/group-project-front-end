# Content Management System (name TBD)
## Prompt
Build an app to build a website! Your app must allow non-technical users to write blog posts **and** pages for the site. When a visitor visits your site, they should see content. When a user logs in, they should see a dashboard that lets them create and edit new posts or pages.

**Reach Goal**: Implement authorization. Administrators should be able to delete pages or posts, while normal users should be able to edit pages. Only administrators can publish a new post, normal users can only save drafts.

## Roles:
  - **Jeremiah**: 
  - **Kevin**:
  - **Robert**:
  - **Jason**:

## Technical Requirements
Our app **MUST**:
- [ ]   **Use Mongo and Express** to build an API.
- [ ] **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user.
- [ ] Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one non-user model.
- [ ]  **Consume your own API** by making a front-end with HTML, Javascript, and jQuery
- [ ]  **Use authentication in your API** to restrict access to appropriate users.
- [ ]  **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github.
- [ ]  Layout and style your front-end with **clean and well-formatted CSS**.
- [ ]  **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Necessary Deliverables
- [ ]  A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the
    internet.
- [ ]  A **client app that consumes your API, built be the whole team**,
 hosted somewhere on the internet.
- [ ]  **At least two Git repositories** (front-end and back-end) **hosted on
    Github**, with frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the
    _very beginning_ of the project.
    - The `README.md` file inside your _**front-end**_ repo should have:

        - [ ] A short description of your application.
        - [ ] A brief explanation of the **technologies** (Node modules, Express
            middleware etc) used.
        - [ ]  A couple of paragraphs detailing the **general approach you took**.
        - [ ] Notes on any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to
            overcome.
        - [ ] **Installation instructions** for any dependencies.
        -   A link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want,
            and why?
        - [ ]  A link to your **ERD** - what data models does your app use?
        - [ ] A link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
            your application.
        - [ ] A link to the deployed front-end app.
        - [ ]  A link to the repo for your back-end.
